<p class=MsoNormal>In addition to the state’s session laws and
constitutions—the standard authoritative sources for each state’s county
creations and changes—the Office of the Secretary of State in Georgia has
produced a number of historical research aids and copies of original sources
that were important to the success of the research and compilation of Georgia
data for the Atlas of Historical County Boundaries. Foremost is Georgia
Counties: Their Changing Boundaries, compiled by Pat Bryant in 1977 and revised
by Ingrid Shields in 1983. The county-by-county lists of the gains and losses
of territory from other counties, together with dates of change and citations
to the legal authorities for the changes, provided a standard against which
atlas staff checked their research in the Georgia laws and other sources.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next to Bryant’s compilation of boundary laws, the most
valuable sources were electronic materials available through the Internet. The
Office of the Secretary of State has digitized and posted to the Internet a
mass of primary source material under the rubric “Georgia’s Virtual Vault:
Digital Treasures from the Georgia Archives”
(http://content.sos.state.ga.us/cdm4/dmf.php). The most useful sets of data
from this collection were “County Maps” (manuscript maps, nearly all from
official surveys in the late 1860s), “Historical Maps” (early printed maps of
the state), and “District Plats of Survey” (manuscript plots of the original
land lot surveys). An additional trove of historical material in electronic
form is available through the Digital Library of Georgia, particularly
“GeogiaInfo” (http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu), put out by the Carl Vinson
Institute of Government at the University of Georgia. Most useful was the
section on “Georgia Maps,” especially the subset called the “Historical Atlas
of Georgia Counties.” This digital “atlas” provided maps showing each county
and its vicinity excerpted from printed maps of Georgia published in different
years from the 1770s into the 2000s; the listing of those maps in the citations
and bibliography of this Alas of Historical County Boundaries follows the style
used to identify them in “GeorgiaInfo.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Dating Changes 1881-2000<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 1877 Georgia adopted a new constitution that included a
provision prohibiting future alterations of county lines without a general law
to control the process. A general boundary law went into effect in 1881,
replacing the practice of legislating each boundary change with a general
requirement that affected counties must agree among themselves on any line
changes; such agreement would be sufficient to modify their mutual boundary.
Unfortunately, that general law (still in effect in 2010) did not require the
counties involved in the locally arranged boundary changes to report their
results to the state government. From then on there was no systematic,
centralized, authoritative record of changes in Georgia’s county network, and
it proved impractical to ascertain the precise date of every change that could
be found.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Atlas staff dealt with that situation by comparing each
county as it was in 1881 to its shape and location on later, more modern maps,
including official state road maps, the federal maps used as bases for
compilation, the maps in the state’s online historical atlas, and the
large-scale individual county maps that the project was able to acquire from
the county surveyors’ offices. If the modern map retained the shape from 1881,
that indicated there had been no change.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>If there was a difference, a review of available maps usually uncovered
a brief period—the years between maps that displayed different versions of the
boundary—when the change was most likely to have occurred. The change was then dated
as having happened “by” the end of that period, that is the publication year
for the map that first showed the change.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Judging from the many differences between Hudgins’ Map of Georgia (1915)
and the Georgia State Highway Department’s “Official 1952 Georgia Highway Map,”
nearly forty counties experienced mappable boundary changes between 1915 and
1952; all those changes had to be dated ”by 31 December 1952”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Comparing Descriptions of Changes<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whenever a reader finds that a description of change in this
atlas disagrees with Pat Bryant’s Georgia Counties, the source of that
disagreement most likely will be the difference between a detailed mapping of
the boundary description and the stated intention of the law. Many county
boundary laws open with a statement of the intended result of the law. As
happened in every other state of the Union, those statements occasionally were
rendered incomplete or inaccurate by various factors, including clerical errors
and geographic ignorance among Georgia’s lawmakers, due chiefly to a lack of
reliable, detailed maps for reference when composing boundary descriptions. The
verbal boundary description in the law is the authoritative version of a county
boundary, even if it does not accomplish the law’s stated intention. Anyone
trying to summarize the impact of a law (e.g., A gained from B and C) either
must rely upon the law’s statement of its anticipated effect or must examine
detailed maps of the boundary before and after the change. Because Pat Bryant
did not plot the boundary lines detailed in the laws she compiled for Georgia
Counties: Their Changing Boundaries lines—and because she had no
before-and-after maps, her principal recourse was the statements of purpose in
the laws. As a result, for any given boundary event, this project’s description
of a change may not match the one in Georgia Counties. For example, the law
that created Fanin County on 21 January 1854 said the new county was being
formed from Gilmer and Union and did not mention Murray, from which Fanin initially
took its westernmost range of land lots. Lacking any alternative source,
Bryant’s book echoes the law and credits territorial contributions from Gilmer
and Union only, whereas this atlas says that all three counties contributed to
Fanin’s creation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Georgia’s Land Surveys<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Starting with the two parcels of land ceded by the Indians
to the national government in 1802 and shortly thereafter transferred to the
state, Georgia inaugurated a system of organizing and surveying the land before
distributing it to settlers through a lottery. (Lotteries were held in seven
different years during the period 1803-1832; they accounted for about two
thirds of the state, roughly all land west of the Oconee River.) Georgia
created a small number of large, named counties within each land cession, then
divided those counties into numbered land districts and further subdivided the
districts into square land lots. The numbers identifying lots were repeated
from district to district; in like fashion, the numbers identifying districts
in one county were repeated for districts in the next county. Although
comparable in principle to the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) employed by the
federal government to organize and distribute the land it acquired from the
Indians outside the original thirteen states, Georgia’s system lacked
uniformity in details. There was notable variation from one cession to another
in the sizes, shapes, and orientations of the districts and, to a lesser
extent, in the sizes of the land lots. Nonetheless, it should be no surprise
that, over time, the lawmakers who created and refined the county network in
the land-lottery region based more and more of their boundary descriptions on
the land lots and their districts, similar to the way boundary makers in areas
organized under the PLSS described their counties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Until very recently, there was no state-wide map or other
comprehensive representation of the land districts and lots; that made it
difficult to map the boundary changes specified in the session laws. This
project sent requests for land lot maps to all the counties west of the Oconee
River, and a large majority of those counties obliged with large-scale maps
from their surveyors. It appeared that digitizing would be at least as
difficult as plotting the historical lines until March 2010, not long after
digitizing had commenced, when the Newberry Library acquired “Georgia Land
Lots”—that is, a donated copy of rGa and Associates’ recently finished
cartographic database of all Georgia land lots and districts—to use as a
reference base for digitizing the old county lines. Without the generosity of
rGa and the counties that furnished maps, compiling and digitizing Georgia’s
historical counties would have been nigh impossible.</p>
